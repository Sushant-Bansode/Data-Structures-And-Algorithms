Rat in a Maze | Backtracking-2

We have discussed Backtracking and Knight’s tour problem in Set 1. 
Let us discuss Rat in a Maze as another example problem that can
be solved using Backtracking.

A Maze is given as N*N binary matrix of blocks where source block is 
the upper left most block i.e., maze[0][0] and destination block 
is lower rightmost block i.e., maze[N-1][N-1]. A rat starts from source and has to reach the destination. The rat can move only in two directions: forward and down. 

In the maze matrix, 0 means the block is a dead end and 1 means the 
block can be used in the path from source to destination. 
Note that this is a simple version of the typical Maze problem. 
For example, a more complex version can be that the rat can move 
in 4 directions and a more complex version can be with a limited number of moves.

Following is an example maze.  

Gray blocks are dead ends (value = 0).

Following is a binary matrix representation of the above maze. 

{1, 0, 0, 0}
{1, 1, 0, 1}
{0, 1, 0, 0}
{1, 1, 1, 1}
Following is a maze with highlighted solution path.

Following is the solution matrix (output of program) for the above input matrix. 

{1, 0, 0, 0}
{1, 1, 0, 0}
{0, 1, 0, 0}
{0, 1, 1, 1}
All entries in solution path are marked as 1.
