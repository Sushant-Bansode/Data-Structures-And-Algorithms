/* Given a number N. The task is to check whether it is sparse or not. 
A number is said to be a sparse number if no two or more consecutive bits are set in the binary representation.

Input: N = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Binary Representation of 2 is 10, 
which is not having consecutive set bits. 
So, it is sparse number.
Example 2:

Input: N = 3
Output: false
Explanation: Binary Representation of 3 is 11, 
which is having consecutive set bits in it. 
So, it is not a sparse number.

Expected Time Complexity: O(log N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
