/*Given an array arr[] of size N containing positive integers and an integer X, find the element in the array which is smaller than X and closest to it.
Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {4 67 13 12 15}
X = 16
Output: 15
Explanation: For a given value 16, there are four values which are smaller than
it. But 15 is the number which is smaller and closest to it with minimum difference
of 1.
Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {1 2 3 4 5}
X = 1
Output: -1
Explanation: No value is smaller than 1.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
